Cloudy Demo
===========

This is a Proof of Concept.

##Main goals:

 - test HTML5 and Canvas usability and performance for writing a game
 - test some Javascript frameworks:
  - performance
  - layering
  - animations, timing
 - test usability on mobile phones:
  - touch control
  - accelerometer
  - performance
 - test browser abilities, compatibility
 

##Used frameworks:

 - EaselJS
 - TweenJS
 - jQuery
 - jQuery Mobile


##Features:
 - works on mobile phone
 - working touch control: page swipe and cloud drag
 - automatic viewport scale
 - independent layers: background, clouds, etc.
 - real sky map converted from svg
 - the "main" clouds are draggable
 - language switching which also works on local file system
 - controllable bubble
 - multiple parallel animations
 - collision detection
 - animated, generated grass
 - day-night cycle
 - stop animation on leaving game page
 - turnable caching
 - turnable "rain" (add a lot of shape)


##Problems:
 - very slow on mobile
 - there are some known bug
 - how to use accelerometer from browser??
